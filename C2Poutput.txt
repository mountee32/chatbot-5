If recommending changes to a specifc file then please give the full file contents and not just the changes, there is no need to also describe the changes unless there is a problem I need to be aware of. 

Don't be lazy, give the full file for each changing file and don't expect me to merge on and new files.
----- Instructions -----------
the AI assistant chat avatar is positioned incorrectly,  Keep the  message on the left side of the chat window, but move the  avatar to the right side of the message bubble next to the message bubble, don't make any other changes

1719153207.2190967 - assistant_message - {"message": "Great! Let's get started with the first question.\n\n**Question 1: Why do you believe the universe exists?**\n\n**WLC:** Well, I believe the universe exists because it was created by God. Just like how an artist paints a picture, God made everything in the universe. This means the planets, stars, animals, and even you and me!\n\n**Dawkins:** I think the universe exists because of natural processes that happened a long, long time ago. Imagine you have a big balloon full of air, and when you pop it, the air spreads out everywhere. That\u2019s kind of what happened with the universe. It began with a big explosion called the Big Bang, and then everything spread out and formed stars, planets, and eventually life.\n\n---\n\n**Question 2: What do you think about how life began on Earth?**\n\n**WLC:** I believe that life began because God wanted it to. Just like how you might build something with your hands or draw a picture, God designed and brought life to Earth with special care and purpose.\n\n**Dawkins:** I believe life began through a process called evolution. Imagine you start with a tiny seed, and over a long, long time, it grows into a big tree. Life on Earth started with tiny, simple organisms and then, over billions of years, changed and grew into all the animals, plants, and people we see today.\n\n---\n\n**Question 3: What is the purpose of life?**\n\n**WLC:** I think the purpose of life is to know and love God. It\u2019s like having a special role in a big story where we are all characters. By learning about God and helping others, we fulfill that special role and make the story even better.\n\n**Dawkins:** I believe the purpose of life is something we each get to decide for ourselves. It's like writing your own story where you choose what makes you happy and what you want to achieve. Whether it\u2019s making friends, learning new things, or helping others, the purpose of life is up to you.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4: What happens when people die?**\n\n**WLC:** I believe that when people die, they don\u2019t just disappear. They go to be with God in heaven if they have lived in a way that\u2019s faithful to Him. It\u2019s like going to a wonderful place where everything is good and you are always happy.\n\n**Dawkins:** I think that when people die, their bodies stop working and that\u2019s the end. But that doesn\u2019t mean life isn\u2019t valuable! It means we should make the most of the time we have, do good things, and enjoy our lives while we\u2019re here.\n\n---\n\n**Question 5: How do we know what is right and wrong?**\n\n**WLC:** I believe we know what is right and wrong because God has given us a guide, like a rulebook, through teachings and messages. These guides help us understand how to treat others, what actions are good, and what we should avoid.\n\n**Dawkins:** I believe we know what is right and wrong through thinking about how our actions affect others. If something we do helps people and makes them happy, it\u2019s right. If it hurts people or causes problems, it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s about being kind and making the world a better place for everyone.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to ask more questions or for more details on these topics!", "prompt": "You are a neutral moderator presenting a respectful dialogue between William Lane Craig (WLC) and Richard Dawkins.
