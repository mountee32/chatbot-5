      "message": "The New Testament starts with the beautiful story of Jesus' birth. It begins in the town of Bethlehem long time ago when a kind woman named Mary, who was actually Jesus' mother, was visited by an angel named Gabriel. Gabriel told Mary that she was chosen by God to have a very special baby, and this baby was Jesus. \n\nIt wasn't an easy start though, because when it was almost time for Jesus to be born, Mary and her husband Joseph had to travel to a different city and they couldn't find a place to stay. Finally, they found a place in a stable, and that's where Jesus was born.\n\nThis event, the birth of Jesus, marks the start of the New Testament. The stories continue from there to tell us all about Jesus' life, his teachings, his parables, and the miracles he performed. The New Testament is essentially an account of all the amazing and kind things Jesus did along with some very important lessons he taught.",

This story is quite beautiful, it's all about how baby Jesus was born in a stable because there was no room at the inn. He was visited by shepherds and three wise men who had followed a bright star to find Him. Do you know why they were looking for Baby Jesus? It's because He wasn't just an ordinary baby, Jesus was also the Son of God, and He was born to tell everyone about God's love.",
