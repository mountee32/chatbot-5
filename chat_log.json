Addition is simply putting two quantities together to get a larger quantity. \n\nInteresting Fact: Did you know that even ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians, Romans, and Mayans, used addition in building their stunning architectural works, in trading goods, and even in keeping time? They all had their unique mathematical systems, and guess what, addition was a part of them!\n\nFun Experiment: You can easily demonstrate addition with some candies, buttons, or any other small objects you have around. For 2+2, place two candies on the table. Then, add two more. Count all the candies. You'll find you now have four candies on the table! You just did the addition problem 2+2!",

We're talking about one of the basic operations of mathematics, which is addition.\n\nSo, when you see \"2+2\", it's like saying you have two apples, and you found two more apples. So, let's count them all together. You start with your first two apples, then add one more (that's a total of three apples) and then add another one. Now, you should have four apples!\n\nSo, 2 (the first two apples) plus 2 (the apples you found) equals 4 apples in total. So 2+2=4! That's how addition works.\n\nLet's practice: if you had 2 cookies and I gave you 2 more cookies, how many cookies would you have in total?\n",
