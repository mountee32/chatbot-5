They all had their unique mathematical systems, and guess what, addition was a part of them!\n\nFun Experiment: You can easily demonstrate addition with some candies, buttons, or any other small objects you have around. For 2+2, place two candies on the table. Then, add two more. Count all the candies. You'll find you now have four candies on the table! You just did the addition problem 2+2!",

We're talking about one of the basic operations of mathematics, which is addition.\n\nSo, when you see \"2+2\", it's like saying you have two apples, and you found two more apples. So, let's count them all together. You start with your first two apples, then add one more (that's a total of three apples) and then add another one. Now, you should have four apples!\n\nSo, 2 (the first two apples) plus 2 (the apples you found) equals 4 apples in total. So 2+2=4!
